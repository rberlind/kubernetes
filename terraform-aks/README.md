# Kubernetes in New Azure Container Service (AKS)
Terraform configuration for deploying Kubernetes in the [new Azure Container Service (AKS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/).

## Introduction
This Terraform configuration replicates what an Azure customer could do with the `az aks create` [CLI command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/aks?view=azure-cli-latest#az_aks_create). It currently uses that command with a local-exec provisioner, but will switch to using the Microsoft AzureRM provider when it adds support for AKS (by supporting the [Managed Clusters REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/container-service/managedclusters)). The configuration creates an entire Kubernetes cluster in AKS including required VMs, networks, and other Azure constructs. Note that this creates a new AKS service which only includes the agent node VMs onto which customers deploy their containerized applications. This differs from the [legacy Azure Container Service (ACS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-service/kubernetes/) which also includes the Kubernetes master node VMs. Those are not created in AKS because Microsoft runs those outside the customer's Azure account. (This makes AKS cheaper than legacy ACS for customers since they are not charged for the master node VMs.)
